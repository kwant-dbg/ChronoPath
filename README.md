An efficient public transit journey planner for **Delhi, India**, built with **C++** and powered by the **RAPTOR algorithm**.  
This project provides a **web-based interface** to find the fastest routes at specific times.

---

## Key Features

-  **Fast & Efficient:** Utilizes the modern **RAPTOR** algorithm for rapid route calculations.  
-  **Time-Dependent:** Finds the best route based on your specified departure time.  
-  **Web Interface:** A clean, simple web UI for entering your start, destination, and time.  
-  **Real-World Data:** Powered by the official GTFS transit data for Delhi.  
-  **Optimal Journeys:** Provides multiple journey options, prioritizing arrival time and minimizing transfers.

##  Live Demo & Screenshots

This is how the application looks in action. The interface allows users to input their journey details, and the map visualizes the resulting route options.

##  The Algorithm: RAPTOR

The core of this project is the **RAPTOR (Round-bAsed Public Transit Optimized Router)** algorithm.  

Unlike classic graph-based algorithms (like Dijkstra's), RAPTOR is **tailored for public transit systems**.  

- Works in **rounds**: each round `k` finds the earliest arrival times at stops with at most `k-1` transfers.  
- Designed for **large-scale transit networks**.  
- Prioritizes **realistic and optimal journeys**.

##  Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler that supports **C++11 or newer** (e.g., GCC/g++).  
- The **Delhi GTFS dataset**, available [here](https://mobilitydatabase.org/feeds/gtfs/mdb-1262).  

### Installation & Execution

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/L0calised/TemporalPathfinder01.git
   cd TemporalPathfinder01
sh

2. **Set up the data:**

   * Create a directory named `data` in the project root.
   * Download the GTFS files (`stops.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, `trips.txt`, etc.) and place them inside the `data` folder.

3. **Compile the source code:**

   ```sh
   g++ Sources/main.cpp Sources/Raptor.cpp -o pathfinder -IHeaders -std=c++11 -pthread
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   ```sh
   ./pathfinder
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   Server starting on http://localhost:8080
   ```

5. **Access the web interface:**
   Open your browser and go to  **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**
